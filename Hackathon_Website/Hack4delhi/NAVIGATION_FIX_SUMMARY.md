# Navigation and Role-Based UI Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Navigation Redirects to Old Interface
**Problem**: After login, clicking navbar options was redirecting users to the old/default interface (index.html, authority.html) which changed the layout and removed logout option.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented role-based dynamic navigation in all pages
- Removed all hardcoded links to `index.html` and `authority.html` from citizen pages
- Admin can access all pages; Citizens restricted to citizen-only pages
- Each page now checks session and renders appropriate navbar based on user role

### 2. ✅ Session Persistence
**Problem**: Session was getting reset during navigation.

**Solution**:
- Session now persists across all navigation
- Only cleared on explicit logout
- Portal page automatically redirects logged-in users to their dashboard
- Index page also redirects logged-in users

### 3. ✅ Shared Complaint Storage
**Problem**: Complaints not syncing between Citizen and Admin modes.

**Solution**:
- All complaints now stored in single `delhiComplaints` localStorage key
- Both citizen and admin read from same storage
- Migration logic added for old complaint keys
- Admin can see all citizen complaints

### 4. ✅ Modal Close Icon Fixed
**Problem**: Cancel/close buttons showing "✖️" instead of "×".

**Solution**:
- Replaced all `✖️` emoji with HTML entity `&times;` (×)
- Styled for proper appearance and clickability

## Files Modified

1. **map.html** - Role-based navigation
2. **complaint.html** - Role-based navigation  
3. **track.html** - Role-based navigation + close icon fix
4. **my-complaints.html** - Role-based navigation + close icon fix
5. **admin-complaints.html** - Role-based navigation + close icon fix
6. **authority.html** - Role-based navigation
7. **index.html** - Auto-redirect logged-in users
8. **auth.js** - Already had delhiComplaints storage (no changes needed)
9. **complaints.js** - Already using delhiComplaints (no changes needed)

## How It Works Now

### After Login Flow

**Citizen Mode:**
```
portal.html → auth.html → citizen-home.html
                              ↓
All navigation stays in citizen interface:
- Home → citizen-home.html
- Map → map.html (with citizen navbar)
- Register → complaint.html (with citizen navbar)
- Track → track.html (with citizen navbar)
- My Complaints → my-complaints.html (with citizen navbar)
- Logout → portal.html
```

**Admin Mode:**
```
portal.html → auth.html → admin-home.html
                              ↓
All navigation stays in admin interface:
- Admin Home → admin-home.html
- Map → map.html (with admin navbar)
- Register → complaint.html (with admin navbar)
- Track → track.html (with admin navbar)
- All Complaints → my-complaints.html (with admin navbar)
- Manage → admin-complaints.html (with admin navbar)
- Authority Dashboard → authority.html (with admin navbar)
- Logout → portal.html
```

### Navigation System

Each page now has:
```javascript
function initializeRoleBasedNavigation(activePage) {
    const session = SessionManager.getSession();
    
    if (!session) {
        window.location.href = 'portal.html'; // Not logged in
        return;
    }

    if (session.role === 'admin') {
        // Render admin navbar with all links
    } else {
        // Render citizen navbar with citizen-only links
    }
}
```

### Session Management

**Login:**
- Session created with role, name, username/phone
- Stored in localStorage under "session" key
- Never cleared during navigation

**Logout:**
- Only clears "session" and "selectedRole" keys
- Redirects to portal.html
- No accidental session resets

**Auto-redirect:**
- index.html and portal.html check for existing session
- Redirect to appropriate dashboard if already logged in
- Prevents seeing old interface when already authenticated

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login as Citizen → navigate to all pages → navbar stays citizen
- [ ] Login as Admin → navigate to all pages → navbar stays admin
- [ ] Click logout → properly returns to portal
- [ ] Register complaint as Citizen → appears in Admin dashboard
- [ ] Close icons show "×" not "+"
- [ ] Session persists across page navigation
- [ ] No redirect to old interface during navigation
- [ ] Direct URL access to protected pages redirects to login

## Notes

- Old pages (index.html, original authority.html) still accessible via direct URL but will redirect logged-in users
- All modal close buttons now use `&times;` HTML entity
- Complaints stored in `delhiComplaints` key for consistency
- Navigation is fully client-side, no page reloads needed (SPA-style would be next enhancement)
